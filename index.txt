About me

I'm a graduating Biomedical Engineering (electrical and computer science focused) student  from University of British Columbia. Through design teams of robotics and Formula Electric I became really interested in the  integration of software and hardware which is the embedded systems. I  find the physical representation of the code  I write in real life pretty  fascinating. 
I wanted to use this platform to not  only present the technical work I've dont but to also show off a little bit of my other areas of strength and passion as well. This is also my lilttle fun playground to see capture and track the growth I gain in different ascpets of life as I move forward! 
I hope you enjoy and learn something interesting about me!
